  A dream and a couple too many beers set the groundwork for Lucky Bucket Brewing Company.  
  Our passion for great beer grew with each barrel we brewed.  
  Sometimes we’d nail it and sometimes it was laughable.  
  But along the way, we brewed a lager that we just couldn’t stop drinking.  
  With a grin on our face and a mug in hand, we knew this was to be our first release: 
  Lucky Bucket Pre-Prohibition Lager, our handcrafted, session beer.  
  From there the rest is history.  
  Hoppy libations, barrel aged ales, bold stouts, tart sour beers – you name it, we brew it!  
  Come and hang out with us at the brewery.  
  We are always here brewing up a new delicious creation.  
  Cheers!
