  With a mission to deliver artisanal, handcrafted spirits, Cut Spike Distillery released its first whiskey in 2012. 
  Single malt whiskey was our motivation to buy stills from Scotland and begin producing great American single malt whiskeys. 
  But our passion for distilling did not stop there; vodka, rum, brandy and small batch spirits are all produced at our distillery. 
  And we are just getting started. Come see us in our tasting room. 
  We will happily mix you a cocktail, or pour you something neat â€“ your call! Cheers!
